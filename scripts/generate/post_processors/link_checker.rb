module PostProcessors
  # Responsible for checking and normalizing links in all of our docs.
  #
  # This classes parses all links out of our markdown files and checks that
  # they are valid and then returns content with the links normalized.
  # The purposes is to automate the tedious task of defining links and
  # ensuring they never become broken.
  #
  # ==== Validation
  #
  # * Local links are validated, ensuring the file exists
  # * External links are validated by making a HEAD request to the endpoint
  # * If link links to a specific section the document is searched to ensure
  #   that section actually exists.
  #
  # ==== "Magic" Short Links
  #
  # The keep the magic alive in Ruby :) Authors of markdown files can use
  # short links without defining their result. For example, you can use
  # [My link][docs.configuration] to link to the `/docs/configuration` page.
  # Auhtors can also use [My link][url.vector_repo] to link to
  # `https://github.com/timberio/vector`. "urls" links are defined in the root
  # `/.metadata.toml` file and "docs" links are automatically inferred from the
  # documentation's file name. If the file name is ambiguous it can be defined
  # directly in the `/.metadata.toml` file.
