# Sinks

![][assets.sinks]

Sinks are last in the [pipeline][docs.configuration#composition], responsible for sending
[events][docs.event] downstream. These can be service specific sinks, such as
[`vector`][docs.sinks.vector], [`elasticsearch`][docs.sinks.elasticsearch], and
[`s3`][docs.sinks.aws_s3], or generic protocol sinks like
[`http`][docs.sinks.http] or [`tcp`][docs.sinks.tcp].
