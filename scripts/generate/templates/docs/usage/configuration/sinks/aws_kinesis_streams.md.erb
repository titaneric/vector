## Examples

The `aws_kinesis_streams` sink batches [`log`][docs.data-model.log] up to the `batch_size` or `batch_timeout` options. When flushed, Vector will write to [AWS Kinesis Data Stream][urls.aws_kinesis_data_streams] via the [`PutRecords` API endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html). The encoding is dictated by the `encoding` option. For example:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: kinesis.<region>.<domain>
Content-Length: <byte_size>
Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1
Connection: Keep-Alive 
X-Amz-Target: Kinesis_20131202.PutRecords
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "Data": "<base64_encoded_event>",
            "PartitionKey": "<partition_key>"
        },
        {
            "Data": "<base64_encoded_event>",
            "PartitionKey": "<partition_key>"
        },
        {
            "Data": "<base64_encoded_event>",
            "PartitionKey": "<partition_key>"
        },
    ],
    "StreamName": "<stream_name>"
}
```

## How It Works [[sort]]

<%= component_sections(component) %>

### Partitioning

By default, Vector issues random 16 byte values for each
[Kinesis record's partition key][urls.aws_kinesis_partition_key], evenly
distributing records across your Kinesis partitions. Depending on your use case
this might not be sufficient since random distribution does not preserve order.
To override this, you can supply the `partition_key_field` option. This option
represents a field on your event to use for the partition key value instead.
This is useful if you have a field already on your event, and it also pairs
nicely with the [`add_fields` transform][docs.transforms.add_fields].

#### Missing keys or blank values

Kenisis requires a value for the partition key and therefore if the key is
missing or the value is blank the event will be dropped and a
[`warning` level log event][docs.monitoring#logs] will be logged. As such,
the field specified in the `partition_key_field` option should always contain
a value.

#### Values that exceed 256 characters

If the value provided exceeds the maximum allowed length of 256 characters
Vector will slice the value and use the first 256 characters.

#### Non-string values

Vector will coerce the value into a string.

#### Provisioning & capacity planning

This is generally outside the scope of Vector but worth touching on. When you
supply your own partition key it opens up the possibility for "hot spots",
and you should be aware of your data distribution for the key you're providing.
Kinesis provides the ability to
[manually split shards][urls.aws_kinesis_split_shards] to accomodate this.
If they key you're using is dynamic and unpredictable we highly recommend
recondsidering your ordering policy to allow for even and random distribution.
