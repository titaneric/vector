### Setup

In order to supply values for both the `host` and `token` options you must first
setup a Splunk HTTP Event Collector. Please refer to the [Splunk setup
docs][urls.splunk_hec_setup] for a guide on how to do this. Once you've setup
your Spunk HTTP Collectory you'll be provided a `host` and `token` that you
should supply to the `host` and `token` options.
