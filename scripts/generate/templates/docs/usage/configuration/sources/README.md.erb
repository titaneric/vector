# Sources

![][assets.sources]

Sources are responsible for ingesting [events][docs.event] into Vector, they can
both receive and pull in data. If you're deploying Vector in an [agent
role][docs.roles.agent], you'll want to look at local data sources like a
[`file`][docs.sources.file] and [`stdin`][docs.sources.stdin]. If you're deploying
Vector in a [service role][docs.roles.service], you'll want to look at sources
that receive data over the network, like the [`vector`][docs.sources.vector],
[`tcp`][docs.sources.tcp], and [`syslog`][docs.sources.syslog] sources.
