# Sources

![][images.sources]

Sources are responsible for ingesting [events][docs.event] into Vector, they can
both receive and pull in data. If you're deploying Vector in an [agent
role][docs.agent_role], you'll want to look at local data sources like a
[`file`][docs.file_source] and [`stdin`][docs.stdin_source]. If you're deploying
Vector in a [service role][docs.service_role], you'll want to look at sources
that receive data over the network, like the [`vector`][docs.vector_source],
[`tcp`][docs.tcp_source], and [`syslog`][docs.syslog_source] sources.
