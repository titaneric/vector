![](../../assets/agent.svg)

Vector is designed to be deployed as a highly-efficient agent, a ride along with your app, taking data from a [file](../../usage/configuration/sources/file.md), [STDIN](../../usage/configuration/sources/stdin.md), and a [variety of other sources](../../usage/configuration/sources/).
