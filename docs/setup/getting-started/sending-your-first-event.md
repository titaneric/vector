# Sending Your First Event

This is a "Hello World" style guide that walks through sending your first
[event][docs.event] through Vector. It designed to be followed locally,
making it quick and easy. We'll start with the simplest of examples: accepting
an event via the [`stdin` source][docs.stdin_source], and then printing it out
via the [`console` sink][docs.console_sink].
