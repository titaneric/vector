# Getting Started

This section will guide you through getting started with Vector. It's designed
to be progressive, starting with a [simple tutorial][docs.sending-your-first-event].
Afterwards, we recommend moving onto [deployments][docs.deployment] so you can
begin to formalize how Vector will fit into your infrastructure.
