# Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have not already done so, please [install Vector](../installation/) first.
{% endhint %}

This section will guide you through getting started with Vector. It's designed to be progressive, starting with a [simple tutorial](sending-your-first-event.md) and expanding into [building out pipelines](creating-your-first-pipeline.md) within Vector. Afterwards, we recommend moving onto [deployments](../deployment/) so you can begin to formalize how Vector will fit into your infrastructure.
