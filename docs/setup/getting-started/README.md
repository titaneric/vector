# Getting Started

This section will guide you through getting started with Vector. It's designed
to be progressive, starting with a [simple tutorial](sending-your-first-event.md).
Afterwards, we recommend moving onto [deployments](../deployment/) so you can
begin to formalize how Vector will fit into your infrastructure.
