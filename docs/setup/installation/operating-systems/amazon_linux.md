# Amazon Linux

Vector can be installed on Amazon Linux through the following methods:

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/yum.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/from-archives.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/from-source.md" %}

YUM is the package manager that ships with Amazon Linux, and it is the method 
we recommend.
