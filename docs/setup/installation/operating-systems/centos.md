# CentOS

Vector can be installed on CentOS through the following methods:

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/yum.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/from-archives.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/from-source.md" %}

YUM is the package manager that ships with CentOS, and is the method we
recommend.
