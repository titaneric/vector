# Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Vector can be installed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux through the following methods:

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/rpm.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../manual/from-archives.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../manual/from-source.md" %}

YUM is the package manager that ships with RHEL, and is the method we
recommend.
