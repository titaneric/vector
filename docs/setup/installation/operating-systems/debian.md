description: Install Vector on the Debian operating system
---

# Debian

Vector can be installed on the Debian operating system through the following
methods:

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/dpkg.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../manual/from-archives.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../manual/from-source.md" %}

DPKG is the package manager that ships with Debian, and is the method we
recommend.
