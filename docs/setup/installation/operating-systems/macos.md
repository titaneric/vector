# MacOS

Vector can be installed on MacOS through the following methods:

{% page-ref page="../package-managers/homebrew.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../manual/from-archives.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../manual/from-source.md" %}

Homebrew is generally the preferred package manager on MacOS, and is the
method we recommend.
