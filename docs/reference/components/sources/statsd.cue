			title: "Timestamps"
			body: #"""
				StatsD protocol does not provide support for sending metric
				timestamps. You'll notice that each parsed metric is assigned a
				`null` timestamp, which is a special value which means "a real
				time metric", i.e. not a historical one. Normally such `null`
				timestamps will be substituted by current time by downstream
				sinks or 3rd party services during sending/ingestion. See the
				[metric][docs.data-model.metric] data model page for more info.
