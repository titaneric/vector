				StatsD protocol does not provide support for sending metric timestamps. You'll
				notice that each parsed metric is assigned a `null` timestamp, which is a
				special value which means "a real time metric", i.e. not a historical one. Normally such
				`null` timestamps will be substituted by current time by downstream sinks or
				3rd party services during sending/ingestion. See the [metric][docs.data-model.metric]
				data model page for more info.
