				The Vector Remap Language (VRL) is a restrictive, fast, and safe language we
				designed specifically for mapping observability data. It avoids the need to
				chain together many fundamental Vector transforms to accomplish rudimentary
				reshaping of data.

				The intent is to offer the same robustness of full language runtime (ex: Lua)
				without paying the performance or safety penalty.

				[Vector Remap Language reference](\#(urls.vrl_reference)).
