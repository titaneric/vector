		An _if_ expression specifies the conditional execution of two branches according to the value of a boolean
		expression. If the boolean expression evaluates to `true`, the "if" branch is executed, otherwise, if present,
		the "else" branch is executed.

		The result of the last expression evaluated in the executed branch or null if no expression is evaluated.
