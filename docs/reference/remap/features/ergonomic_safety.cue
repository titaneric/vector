		VRL is ergonomically safe, preventing the production of slow and unmaintainable VRL programs. While VRL's
		[compile-time checks](#\(features.compilation.anchor)) prevent runtime errors, they do not prevent more
		ellusive problems that result from program complexity, like performance or maintainability problems. These
		are pernicious problems that result in pipeline instability and high cost. To protect against this, VRL is
		*intentionally* designed with the thoughtful ergonomics that come in the form of limitations.

				VRL lacks the ability to hold and maintain state across events. This prevents unbounded memory growth,
