We cover it below to help you upgrade quickly:

[##](##) Upgrade Guide

### Datadog Log sink encoding option removed {#encoding}

In previous versions of vector it was possible to configure the Datadog logs
sink to send in 'text' or 'json' encoding. While the logs ingest API does accept
text format the native format for that API is json. Sending text comes with
limitations and is only useful for backward compatability with older clients.

We no longer allow you to set the encoding of the payloads in the Datadog logs
sink. For instance, if your configuration looks like so:

```toml
[sinks.dd_logs_egress]
type = "datadog_logs"
inputs = ["datadog_agent"]
encoding.codec = "json"
```

You should remove `encoding.codec` entirely, leaving you with:

```toml
[sinks.dd_logs_egress]
type = "datadog_logs"
inputs = ["datadog_agent"]
```

Encoding fields other than `codec` are still valid.
