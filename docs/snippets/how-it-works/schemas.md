Vector is schema-neutral and doesn't require any specific schema. This ensures that Vector can work with a variety of schemas, supporting legacy schemas as well as future schemas.

We *do* plan to implement a common information model for Vector that would recognize popular schemas, allowing you to seamlessly transform between schemas. You can track progress on this work in [issue 3910][3910].
