# Data Model

This section will provide a deeper dive into Vector's data model.

## Event

Vector characterizes all data flowing through Vector as "events". Events must be
one of 2 types:

{% page-ref page="log.md" %}

{% page-ref page="metric.md" %}

Each section above will provide a deeper dive into that specific event type.
