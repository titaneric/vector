{% hint style="warning" %}
The `file` source is in beta. Please see the current [enhancements](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Source%3A+file%22+label%3A%22Type%3A+Enhancement%22) and [bugs](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Source%3A+file%22+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22) for known issues. We kindly ask that you [add any missing issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues/new?labels=Source%3A+file) as it will help shape the roadmap of this component.
{% endhint %}
The `file` source continuously ingests [`log`][docs.log_event] events through one or more local files.

## Options

| Key  | Type  | Description |

| `exclude` | `[string]` | Array of file patterns to exclude. [Globbing](#globbing) is supported. *Takes precedence over the `include` option.*<br />`required` `example: ["/var/log/nginx*.log"]` |

## Examples



Given the following input:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="/var/log/rails.log" %}
```
2019-02-13T19:48:34+00:00 [info] Started GET "/" for 127.0.0.1
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

A [`log` event][docs.log_event] will be emitted with the following structure:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="log" %}
```javascript
{
  "timestamp": <timestamp> # current time,
  "message": "2019-02-13T19:48:34+00:00 [info] Started GET "/" for 127.0.0.1",
  "file": "/var/log/rails.log", # original file
  "host": "10.2.22.122" # current nostname
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

The `"timestamp"`, `"file"`, and `"host"` keys were automatically added as context. You can further parse the `"message"` key with a [transform][docs.transforms], such as the [`regeex` transform][docs.regex_parser_transform].




## How It Works

### Auto Discovery

Vector will continually look for new files matching any of your include patterns. If a new file is added that matches any of the supplied patterns, Vector will begin tailing it. Vector maintains a unique list of files and will not tail a file more than once, even if it matches multiple patterns. You can read more about how we identify file in the Identification section.

### Context

Each event is augmented with contextual fields controlled by the `file_key` and `host_key` options. Please see the descriptions for each respective option.

### Correctness

The `file` source has been involved in the following correctness tests:

* [`file_rotate_create_correctness`][url.file_rotate_create_correctness_test]
* [`file_rotate_truncate_correctness`][url.file_rotate_truncate_correctness_test]
* [`file_truncate_correctness`][url.file_truncate_correctness_test]

Learn more in the [Correctness][docs.correctness] sections.

### Delivery Guarantee

Due to the nature of this component, it offers a **best effort**
delivery guarantee.

### File Deletions

If a file is deleted Vector will flush the current buffer and stop tailing the file.

### File Identification

Vector identifies files by creating a [cyclic redundancy check (CRC)][url.crc] on the first 256 bytes of the file. This serves as a fingerprint to uniquely identify the file. This strategy avoids the common pitfalls of using device and inode names since inode names, allowing Vector to [properly tail files in the event of rotation][docs.correctness].

### File Rotation

Vector will follow files across rotations in the manner of tail, and because of the way Vector [identifies files](#file-identification), Vector will properly recognize newly rotated files regardless if you are using `copytruncate` or `create` directive. To ensure Vector handles rotated files properly we recommend:

1. Ensure the `includes` paths include rotated files. For example, use `/var/log/nginx*.log` to recognize `/var/log/nginx.2.log`.
2. Use either the `copytruncate` or `create` directives when rotating files. If historical data is compressed, or altered in any way, Vector will not be able to properly identify the file.
3. Only delete files when they have exceeded the `ignore_older` age. While extremely rare, this ensures you do not delete data before Vector has a chance to ingest it.

### Globbing

[Globbing][url.globbing] is supported in all provided file paths, files will be [autodiscovered](#auto_discovery) continually.

### Line Delimiters

Each line is read until a new line delimiter (the `0xA` byte) or `EOF` is found.

### Performance

The `file` source has been involved in the following performance tests:

* [`file_to_tcp_performance`][url.file_to_tcp_performance_test]

Learn more in the [Performance][docs.performance] sections.

### Read Position

Vector defaults to reading new data only. Only data added to the file after Vector starts tailing the file will be collected. To read from the beginning of the file set the `start_at_beginning` option to true.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open source issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Source%3A+file%22).
2. [Search the forum][url.search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][url.community] for help.
