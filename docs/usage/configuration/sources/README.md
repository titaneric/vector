# Sources

![](../../../assets/sources.svg)

Sources are responsible for ingesting [events](../../../about/data-model.md#event) into Vector, they can both receive and pull in data. If you're deploying Vector in an [agent role](../../../setup/deployment/roles/agent.md), you'll want to look at local data sources like a [`file`](file.md) and [`stdin`](stdin.md). If you're deploying Vector in a [service role](../../../setup/deployment/roles/service.md), you'll want to look at sources that receive data over the network, like the [`vector`](vector.md), [`tcp`](tcp.md), and [`syslog`](syslog.md) sources.

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| [**`file`**](file.md) | Ingests data through one or more local files and outputs ["[`log`][log_event]"] events.<br />`guarantee: best_effort` |
| [**`statsd`**](statsd.md) | Ingests data through the StatsD UDP protocol and outputs ["[`log`][log_event]"] events.<br />`guarantee: best_effort` |
| [**`stdin`**](stdin.md) | Ingests data through standard input (STDIN) and outputs ["[`log`][log_event]"] events.<br />`guarantee: at_least_once` |
| [**`syslog`**](syslog.md) | Ingests data through the Syslog 5424 protocol and outputs ["[`log`][log_event]"] events.<br />`guarantee: best_effort` |
| [**`tcp`**](tcp.md) | Ingests data through the TCP protocol and outputs ["[`log`][log_event]"] events.<br />`guarantee: best_effort` |
| [**`vector`**](vector.md) | Ingests data through another upstream Vector instance and outputs ["[`log`][log_event]"] events.<br />`guarantee: best_effort` |
