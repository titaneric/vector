# add_fields transform

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/add_fields-transform.svg)


The `add_fields` transforms accepts [`log`][log_event] and [`metric`][metric_event] events and allows you to add one or more fields.

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (examples)" %}
```coffeescript
[transforms.my_add_fields_transform]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "add_fields"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (schema)" %}
```coffeescript
[transforms.<transform-id>]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "<string>"
  inputs = "<string>"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

| Key  | Type  | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---------- |
| **REQUIRED** - General | | |
| `inputs` | `string` | A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs. See [Config Composition][config_composition] for more info.<br />`required` `example: ["my-source-id"]` |

## Input

The `add_fields` accepts [`log`][log_event] and [`metric`][metric_event] events.

## Output

The `add_fields` outputs [`log`][log_event] and [`metric`][metric_event] events.



## How It Works

### Complex Comparisons

The `field_filter` transform is designed for simple equality filtering, it is not designed for complex comparisons. There are plans to build a `filter` transform that accepts more complex filtering. See [Issue #479][issue_479] for more info.

### Complex Transforming

The `add_fields` transform is designed for simple key additions. If you need more complex transforming then we recommend using a more versatile transform like the [`lua` transform][lua_transform].

### Environment Variables

As described in the [Configuration document][configuration], Vector will interpolate environment variables in your configuration file. This can be helpful when adding fields, such as adding a `"host"` field as shown in the example.

### Key Conflicts

Keys specified in this transform will replace existing keys.

### Nested Fields

As described in the [Data Model][data_model] document, Vector represents events as flat maps, and nested fields are denoted by a `.` character in the key name. Therefore, adding nested fields is as simple as adding a `.` to your key name:

```
[transforms.<transform-id>]
  # ...
  
  [transforms.<transform-id>.fields]
    "parent.child.grandchild" = "<value>"
```

### Removing Fields

See the [`remove_fields` transform][remove_fields_transform].

### Special Characters

Aside from the [special characters][event_key_special_characters] listed in the [Data Model][data_model] doc, Vector does not restrict the characters allowed in keys. You can wrap key names in `" "` quote to preserve spaces and use `\` to escape quotes.

### Value Types

All supported [configuration value types][config_value_types] are accepted.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting].

### Getting help

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open transform issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Transform%3A+add_fields%22).
2. [Search the forum][search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][community] for help.
