# log\_to\_metric transform

The `log_to_metric` transform allows you to convert [`log`](../../../about/data-model.md#log) events to [`metric`](../../../about/data-model.md#metric) events, making it possible to reduce logs to metrics and forward the results to the metrics system\(s\) of your choice.
