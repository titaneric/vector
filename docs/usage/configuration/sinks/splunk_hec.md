# splunk_hec sink

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/splunk_hec-sink.svg)


The `splunk_hec` sink batch and flushes [`log`][log_event] events to a [Splunk HTTP Event Collector][splunk_hec].

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (examples)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.my_splunk_hec_sink]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "splunk_hec"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]

  # OPTIONAL - General
  host = "my-splunk-host.com" # no default
  token = "A94A8FE5CCB19BA61C4C08" # no default

  # OPTIONAL - Batching
  batch_size = 1049000 # default, bytes
  batch_timeout = 1 # default, bytes

  # OPTIONAL - Requests
  encoding = "ndjson" # no default, one of: ndjson, text
  rate_limit_duration = 1 # default, seconds
  rate_limit_num = 10 # default
  request_in_flight_limit = 10 # default
  request_timeout_secs = 60 # default, seconds
  retry_attempts = 5 # default
  retry_backoff_secs = 5 # default, seconds
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (schema)" %}
```coffeescript
[sink.<sink-id>]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "<string>"
  inputs = "<string>"

  # OPTIONAL - General
  host = "<string>"
  token = "<string>"

  # OPTIONAL - Batching
  batch_size = <int>
  batch_timeout = <int>

  # OPTIONAL - Requests
  encoding = {ndjson | text}
  rate_limit_duration = <int>
  rate_limit_num = <int>
  request_in_flight_limit = <int>
  request_timeout_secs = <int>
  retry_attempts = <int>
  retry_backoff_secs = <int>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

| `retry_attempts` | `int` | The maximum number of retries to make for failed requests. See [Retry Policy](#retry-policy) for more info.<br />`default: 5` |
| `retry_backoff_secs` | `int` | The amount of time to wait before attempting a failed request again. See [Retry Policy](#retry-policy) for more info.<br />`default: 5` `unit: seconds` |

## I/O

The `splunk_hec` sink batches events up to the `batch_size` or `batch_timeout` options. When flushed, Vector will write to a [Splunk HTTP Event Collector][splunk_hec]. The encoding is dictated by the `encoding` option. For example:
The `splunk_hec` sink batches and flushes events over an configurable interval. Each event is encoded as dictated by the `encoding` option. See [Encoding](#encoding) for more info.



## How It Works

### Delivery Guarantee

This component offers an **at least once** delivery guarantee if your
[pipeline is configured to achieve this][at_least_once_delivery].

### Encodings

The `splunk_hec` sink encodes events before flushing. This is controlled via the `encoding` option. Each encoding type is described in more detail below:

| Encoding | Description |
| `ndjson` | The payload will be encoded in new line delimited JSON payload, each line representing a JSON encoded event. |
| `text` | The payload will be encoded as new line delimited text, each line representing the value of the `"message"` key. |

### Health Checks

Vector will perform a simple health check against the underlying service before initializing this sink. This ensures that the service is reachable. You can require this check with the `--require-healthy` flag upon [starting][starting] Vector.

### Setup

In order to supply values for both the `host` and `token` options you must first setup a Splunk HTTP Event Collector. Please refer to the [Splunk setup docs][splunk_hec_setup] for a guide on how to do this. Once you've setup your Spunk HTTP Collectory you'll be provided a `host` and `token`
that you should supply to the `host` and `token` options.

### Batching

By default, the `splunk_hec` sink flushes every 1 seconds to ensure data is available quickly. This can be changed by adjusting the `batch_timeout` and `batch_size` options.

### Rate Limiting

Vector offers a few levers to control the rate and volume of requests. Start with the `rate_limit_duration` and `rate_limit_num` options to ensure Vector does not exceed the specified number of requests in the specified window. You can further control the pace at which this window is saturated with the `request_in_flight_limit` option, which will guarantee no more than the specified number of requests are in-flight at any given time.

  Please note, Vector's defaults are carefully chosen and it should be rare that you need to adjust these.

### Retry Policy

Vector will retry failed requests (status == `429`, >= `500`, and != `501`). Other responses will not be retried. You can control the number of retry attempts and backoff rate with the `retry_attempts` and `retry_backoff_secs` options.

### Timeouts

The default `request_timeout_secs` option is based on the underlying timeout. It is highly recommended that you do not lower this below the service's timeout, as this could create orphaned requests and pile on retries.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open sink issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Sink%3A+splunk_hec%22).
2. [Search the forum][search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][community] for help.
