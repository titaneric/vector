# console sink

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/console-sink.svg)


The `console` sink streams [`log`][log_event] and [`metric`][metric_event] events to the console, `STDOUT` or `STDERR`.

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (examples)" %}
```coffeescript
[sources.my_console_sink]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "console"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]

  # OPTIONAL - General
  encoding = "json" # no default
  target = "stdout" # no default
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (schema)" %}
```coffeescript
[sink.<sink-id>]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "<string>"
  inputs = "<string>"

  # OPTIONAL - General
  encoding = "<string>"
  target = "<string>"
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

| Key  | Type  | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---------- |
| **REQUIRED** - General | | |
| `inputs` | `string` | A list of upstream [source][sources] or [transform][transforms] IDs. See [Config Composition][config_composition] for more info.<br />`required` `example: ["my-source-id"]` |
| **OPTIONAL** - General | | |
| `encoding` | `string` | The encoding format used to serialize the events before writing. See [Encodings](#encodings) for more info.<br />`no default` `enum: "json", "text"` |
| `target` | `string` | The [standard stream][standard_streams] to write to.<br />`no default` `enum: "stdout", "stderr"` |

## Input

The `console` sink accepts [`log`][log_event] and [`metric`][metric_event] events.

## Output

The `console` sink streams events to the console, `STDOUT` or `STDERR`. The encoding of each event is dictated by the `encoding` option.

The `console` sink streams events in a real-time fashion. Each event is encoded as dictated by the `encoding` option. See [Encoding](#encoding) for more info.

## Delivery Guarantee

Due to nature of writing data to the console, `STDOUT` or `STDERR`, the `console` sink
makes a [best effort delivery guarantee][best_effort_delivery].



## How It Works

### Encodings

The `console` sink encodes events before flushing. This is controlled via the `encoding` option. Each encoding type is described in more detail below:

| Encoding | Description |
| `json` | The payload will be encoded as a single JSON payload. |
| `text` | The payload will be encoded as new line delimited text, each line representing the value of the `"message"` key. |

### Health Checks

Vector will perform a simple health check against the underlying service before initializing this sink. This ensures that the service is reachable. You can require this check with the `--require-healthy` flag upon [starting][starting] Vector.

### Streaming

Events will be streamed in a real-time, one-by-one fashiong, making
events immediately available. They will not be batched.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting].
