# console sink

![](../../../assets/console-sink.svg)


The `console` sink streams [`log`][docs.log_event] and [`metric`][docs.metric_event] events to the console, `STDOUT` or `STDERR`.

## How It Works

### Buffers

Vector couples buffers with each sink, this offers a number of advantages over a single shared global buffer. In general, you should configure your sink's buffer to exceed the `batch_size`. This is especially true when using on-disk buffers, as it ensures data is not lost in the event of restarts.

#### Buffer Types

The `buffer.type` option allows you to control buffer resource usage:

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| `memory` | Pros: Fast. Cons: Not persisted across restarts. Possible data loss in the event of a crash. Uses more memory. |
| `disk` | Pros: Persisted across restarts, durable. Uses much less memory. Cons: Slower, see below. |

#### Buffer Overflow

The `buffer.when_full` option allows you to control the behavior when the buffer overflows:

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| `block` | Applies back pressure until the buffer makes room. This will help to prevent data loss but will cause data to pile up on the edge. |
| `drop_newest` | Drops new data as it's received. This data is lost. This should be used when performance is the highest priority. |

### Delivery Guarantee

Due to the nature of this component, it offers a **best effort**
delivery guarantee.

### Encodings

The `console` sink encodes events before flushing. This is controlled via the `encoding` option. Each encoding type is described in more detail below:

| Encoding | Description |
| :------- | :---------- |
| `json` | The payload will be encoded as a single JSON payload. |
| `text` | The payload will be encoded as new line delimited text, each line representing the value of the `"message"` key. |

### Health Checks

Vector will perform a simple health check against the underlying service before initializing this sink. This ensures that the service is reachable. You can require this check with the `--require-healthy` flag upon [starting][docs.starting] Vector:

```bash
vector --config /etc/vector/vector.toml --require-healthy
```

### Streaming

Events will be streamed in a real-time, one-by-one fashiong, making
events immediately available. They will not be batched.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open sink issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Sink%3A+console%22).
2. [Search the forum][url.search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][url.community] for help.
