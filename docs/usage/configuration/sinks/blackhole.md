# blackhole sink

![][images.blackhole_sink]


The `blackhole` sink [streams](#streaming) [`log`][docs.log_event] and [`metric`][docs.metric_event] events to a blackhole that simply discards data, designed for testing and benchmarking purposes.

## Config File

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (example)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.my_sink_id]
  type = "blackhole" # must be: "blackhole"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  print_amount = 1000
  
  healthcheck = true # default
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (schema)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.<sink-id>]
  type = "blackhole"
  inputs = ["<string>", ...]
  print_amount = <int>
  healthcheck = <bool>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml (specification)" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.blackhole_sink]
  # The component type
  # 
  # * required
  # * no default
  # * must be: "blackhole"
  type = "blackhole"

  # A list of upstream source or transform IDs. See Config Composition for more
  # info.
  # 
  # * required
  # * no default
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]

  # The number of events that must be received in order to print a summary of
  # activity.
  # 
  # * required
  # * no default
  print_amount = 1000

  # Enables/disables the sink healthcheck upon start.
  # 
  # * optional
  # * default: true
  healthcheck = true
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

| Key  | Type  | Description |
|:-----|:-----:|:------------|
| **REQUIRED** | | |
| `type` | `string` | The component type<br />`required` `must be: "blackhole"` |
| `inputs` | `[string]` | A list of upstream [source][docs.sources] or [transform][docs.transforms] IDs. See [Config Composition][docs.config_composition] for more info.<br />`required` `example: ["my-source-id"]` |
| `print_amount` | `int` | The number of events that must be received in order to print a summary of activity.<br />`required` `example: 1000` |
| **OPTIONAL** | | |
| `healthcheck` | `bool` | Enables/disables the sink healthcheck upon start. See [Health Checks](#health-checks) for more info.<br />`default: true` |

## How It Works

### Delivery Guarantee

Due to the nature of this component, it offers a
[**best effort** delivery guarantee][docs.best_effort_delivery].

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the [Environment Variables][docs.configuration.environment-variables]
section.

### Health Checks

Health checks ensure that the downstream service is accessible and ready to
accept data. This check is performed upon sink initialization.

If the health check fails an error will be logged and Vector will proceed to
start. If you'd like to exit immediately upon health check failure, you can
pass the `--require-healthy` flag:

```bash
vector --config /etc/vector/vector.toml --require-healthy
```

And finally, if you'd like to disable health checks entirely for this sink
you can set the `healthcheck` option to `false`.

### Streaming

The `blackhole` sink streams data on a real-time
event-by-event basis. It does not batch data.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open `blackhole_sink` issues][url.blackhole_sink_issues].
2. If encountered a bug, please [file a bug report][url.new_blackhole_sink_bug].
3. If encountered a missing feature, please [file a feature request][url.new_blackhole_sink_enhancement].
4. If you need help, [join our chat/forum community][url.vector_chat]. You can post a question and search previous questions.
