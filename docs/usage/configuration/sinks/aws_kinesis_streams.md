# aws_kinesis_streams sink

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/aws_kinesis_streams-sink.svg)


The `aws_kinesis_streams` sink batch and flushes [`log`][log_event] events to [AWS Kinesis Data Stream][aws_kinesis_data_streams] via the [`PutRecords` API endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html).

## Example

  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "aws_kinesis_streams"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  region = "us-east-1"
  stream_name = "my-stream"

  # OPTIONAL - Batching

## I/O

The `aws_kinesis_streams` sink batches events up to the `batch_size` or `batch_timeout` options. When flushed, Vector will write to [AWS Kinesis Data Stream][aws_kinesis_data_streams] via the [`PutRecords` API endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html). The encoding is dictated by the `encoding` option. For example:
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: kinesis.<region>.<domain>
Content-Length: <byte_size>
Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1
Connection: Keep-Alive 
X-Amz-Target: Kinesis_20131202.PutRecords
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "Data": "<base64_encoded_event>",
            "PartitionKey": "<partition_key>"
        },
        {
            "Data": "<base64_encoded_event>",
            "PartitionKey": "<partition_key>"
        },
        {
            "Data": "<base64_encoded_event>",
            "PartitionKey": "<partition_key>"
        },
    ],
    "StreamName": "<stream_name>"
}
```



## How It Works

### Authentication

Vector checks for AWS credentials in the following order:

1. Environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
​2. [`credential_process` command][aws_credential_process] in the AWS config file, usually located at `~/.aws/config`.
​3. [AWS credentials file][aws_credentials_file], usually located at `~/.aws/credentials`.
4. ​[IAM instance profile][iam_instance_profile]. Will only work if running on an EC2 instance with an instance profile/role.

If credentials are not found the [healtcheck](#healthchecks) will fail and an error will be [logged][monitoring_logs].

#### Obtaining an access key

In general, we recommend using instance profiles/roles whenever possible. In cases where this is not possible you can generate an AWS access key for any user within your AWS account. AWS provides a [detailed guide][aws_access_keys] on how to do this.

### Delivery Guarantee

This component offers an **at least once** delivery guarantee if your
[pipeline is configured to achieve this][at_least_once_delivery].

### Encodings

The `aws_kinesis_streams` sink encodes events before flushing. This is controlled via the `encoding` option. Each encoding type is described in more detail below:

| Encoding | Description |
| `json` | The payload will be encoded as a single JSON payload. |
| `text` | The payload will be encoded as new line delimited text, each line representing the value of the `"message"` key. |

### Health Checks

Vector will perform a simple health check against the underlying service before initializing this sink. This ensures that the service is reachable. You can require this check with the `--require-healthy` flag upon [starting][starting] Vector.

### Batching

By default, the `aws_kinesis_streams` sink flushes every 1 seconds to ensure data is available quickly. This can be changed by adjusting the `batch_timeout` and `batch_size` options.Keep in mind that the underlying service will only accept payloads up to [a maximum size and a maximum frequency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html).

### Rate Limiting

Vector offers a few levers to control the rate and volume of requests. Start with the `rate_limit_duration` and `rate_limit_num` options to ensure Vector does not exceed the specified number of requests in the specified window. You can further control the pace at which this window is saturated with the `request_in_flight_limit` option, which will guarantee no more than the specified number of requests are in-flight at any given time.

  Please note, Vector's defaults are carefully chosen and it should be rare that you need to adjust these.

### Retry Policy

Vector will retry failed requests (status == `429`, >= `500`, and != `501`). Other responses will not be retried. You can control the number of retry attempts and backoff rate with the `retry_attempts` and `retry_backoff_secs` options.

### Timeouts

The default `request_timeout_secs` option is based on the underlying timeout. It is highly recommended that you do not lower this below the service's timeout, as this could create orphaned requests and pile on retries.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][monitoring_logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open sink issues](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Sink%3A+aws_kinesis_streams%22).
2. [Search the forum][search_forum] for any similar issues.
2. Reach out to the [community][community] for help.
