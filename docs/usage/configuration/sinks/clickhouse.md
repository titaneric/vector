# clickhouse sink

![][assets.clickhouse_sink]

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `clickhouse` sink is in beta. Please see the current
[enhancements][urls.clickhouse_sink_enhancements] and
[bugs][urls.clickhouse_sink_bugs] for known issues.
We kindly ask that you [add any missing issues][urls.new_clickhouse_sink_issue]
as it will help shape the roadmap of this component.
{% endhint %}

The `clickhouse` sink [batches](#buffers-and-batches) [`log`][docs.data-model.log] events to [Clickhouse][urls.clickhouse] via the [`HTTP` Interface][urls.clickhouse_http].

## Example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="vector.toml" %}
```coffeescript
[sinks.my_sink_id]
  # REQUIRED - General
  type = "clickhouse" # must be: "clickhouse"
  inputs = ["my-source-id"]
  host = "http://localhost:8123"
  table = "mytable"
  
  # OPTIONAL - Requests
  compression = "gzip" # no default, must be: "gzip" (if supplied)
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Options

### basic_auth.*

#### basic_auth.password

`required` `example: "password"`

`no default` `must be: "gzip"`

The compression type to use before writing data. See [Compression](#compression) for more info.

### database

`no default` `example: "mydatabase"`

The database that contains the stable that data will be inserted into.

### healthcheck

`default: true`

Enables/disables the sink healthcheck upon start. See [Health Checks](#health-checks) for more info.

The host url of the [Clickhouse][urls.clickhouse] server.

### inputs

`required` `example: ["my-source-id"]`

A list of upstream [source][docs.sources] or [transform][docs.transforms] IDs. See [Config Composition][docs.configuration#composition] for more info.

### rate_limit_duration

`default: 1` `unit: seconds`

The window used for the `request_rate_limit_num` option See [Rate Limits](#rate-limits) for more info.

### rate_limit_num

`default: 5`

The maximum number of requests allowed within the `rate_limit_duration` window. See [Rate Limits](#rate-limits) for more info.

### request_in_flight_limit

`default: 5`

The maximum number of in-flight requests allowed at any given time. See [Rate Limits](#rate-limits) for more info.

### request_timeout_secs

`default: 30` `unit: seconds`

The maximum time a request can take before being aborted. See [Timeouts](#timeouts) for more info.

### retry_attempts

`default: 9223372036854775807`

The maximum number of retries to make for failed requests. See [Retry Policy](#retry-policy) for more info.

### retry_backoff_secs

`default: 9223372036854775807` `unit: seconds`

The amount of time to wait before attempting a failed request again. See [Retry Policy](#retry-policy) for more info.

### table

`required` `example: "mytable"`

The table that data will be inserted into.

### tls.*

#### tls.ca_path

`no default` `example: (see above)`

Absolute path to an additional CA certificate file, in DER or PEM format (X.509).

#### tls.crt_path

`no default` `example: (see above)`

Absolute path to a certificate file used to identify this connection, in DER or PEM format (X.509) or PKCS#12. If this is set and is not a PKCS#12 archive, `key_path` must also be set.

#### tls.key_pass

`no default` `example: "PassWord1"`

Pass phrase used to unlock the encrypted key file. This has no effect unless `key_pass` above is set.

#### tls.key_path

`no default` `example: (see above)`

Absolute path to a certificate key file used to identify this connection, in DER or PEM format (PKCS#8). If this is set, `crt_path` must also be set.

#### tls.verify_certificate

`default: true`

If `true` (the default), Vector will validate the TLS certificate of the remote host. Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote certificate.

#### tls.verify_hostname

`default: true`

If `true` (the default), Vector will validate the configured remote host name against the remote host's TLS certificate. Do NOT set this to `false` unless you understand the risks of not verifying the remote hostname.

### type

`required` `must be: "clickhouse"`

The component type

## How It Works

### Compression

The `clickhouse` sink compresses payloads before
flushing. This helps to reduce the payload size, ultimately reducing bandwidth
and cost. This is controlled via the `compression` option. Each compression
type is described in more detail below:

| Compression | Description |
|:------------|:------------|
| `gzip` | The payload will be compressed in [Gzip][urls.gzip] format before being sent. |

### Delivery Guarantee

Due to the nature of this component, it offers a
[**best effort** delivery guarantee][docs.guarantees#best-effort-delivery].

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are supported through all of Vector's configuration.
Simply add `${MY_ENV_VAR}` in your Vector configuration file and the variable
will be replaced before being evaluated.

You can learn more in the [Environment Variables][docs.configuration#environment-variables]
section.

### Health Checks

Health checks ensure that the downstream service is accessible and ready to
accept data. This check is performed upon sink initialization.

If the health check fails an error will be logged and Vector will proceed to
start. If you'd like to exit immediately upon health check failure, you can
pass the `--require-healthy` flag:

```bash
vector --config /etc/vector/vector.toml --require-healthy
```

And finally, if you'd like to disable health checks entirely for this sink
you can set the `healthcheck` option to `false`.

### Rate Limits

Vector offers a few levers to control the rate and volume of requests to the
downstream service. Start with the `rate_limit_duration` and `rate_limit_num`
options to ensure Vector does not exceed the specified number of requests in
the specified window. You can further control the pace at which this window is
saturated with the `request_in_flight_limit` option, which will guarantee no
more than the specified number of requests are in-flight at any given time.

Please note, Vector's defaults are carefully chosen and it should be rare that
you need to adjust these. If you found a good reason to do so please share it
with the Vector team by [opening an issie][urls.new_clickhouse_sink_issue].

### Retry Policy

Vector will retry failed requests (status == `429`, >= `500`, and != `501`).
Other responses will _not_ be retried. You can control the number of retry
attempts and backoff rate with the `retry_attempts` and `retry_backoff_secs` options.

### Timeouts

To ensure the pipeline does not halt when a service fails to respond Vector
will abort requests after `30 seconds`.
This can be adjsuted with the `request_timeout_secs` option.

It is highly recommended that you do not lower value below the service's
internal timeout, as this could create orphaned requests, pile on retries,
and result in deuplicate data downstream.

## Troubleshooting

The best place to start with troubleshooting is to check the
[Vector logs][docs.monitoring#logs]. This is typically located at
`/var/log/vector.log`, then proceed to follow the
[Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting].

If the [Troubleshooting Guide][docs.troubleshooting] does not resolve your
issue, please:

1. Check for any [open `clickhouse_sink` issues][urls.clickhouse_sink_issues].
2. If encountered a bug, please [file a bug report][urls.new_clickhouse_sink_bug].
3. If encountered a missing feature, please [file a feature request][urls.new_clickhouse_sink_enhancement].
4. If you need help, [join our chat/forum community][urls.vector_chat]. You can post a question and search previous questions.
