# Glossary

## Batch

A batch refers to a [batched payload](../about/data-model.md#batched-payload) within a sink. It is a batch of events encoded into a payload that the downstream service understands.

## Benchmark

A benchmark refers to a test designed to measure performance and resource usage. You can learn more about Vector's benchmarks in the [Benchmarks](../comparisons/performance.md) section.

## Binary

A binary refers to the static binary that Vector compiles to. 

## Buffer

A buffer refers to an ordered queue of events that is coupled with a sink. You can learn more about buffers in the [`*.buffers`](../usage/configuration/sinks/buffer.md) section.

## Configuration

Configuration refers to the settings and options used to control Vector's behavior. You can learn more about Vector's configuration in the [Configuration](../usage/configuration/) section.

## Durability

Durability refers to the ability to retain data across exceptional events. In the context of Vector, this typically refers to the ability to retain data across restarts.

## Event

Event refers to a single unit of data that flows through Vector. You can learn more about events in the [Data Model](../about/data-model.md) section.

## Filter

A filter refers to a type of [transform](../usage/configuration/transforms/) that filters events or fields on an event.

## Flush

A flush refers to the act of sending a batched payload to a downstream service. It is a common term used in conjunction with "buffer".

## Github

[Github](https://github.com/) refers to the service used to host Vector's source code.

## Guide

A guide is a tutorial or walk through on a specific subject. You can see Vector's guides in the [Guides](../usage/guides/) section.
