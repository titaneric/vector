# Default values for vector.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# Override some values globally from a single location instead of specifying
# them in each chart.
# Note: these values are also respected by all charts, so you can keep using
# them if you switch from the `vector` chart the specific role oriented charts.

vector-aggregator:
  # See the possible settings at the `vector-aggregator` chart.
