We're currently [experimenting with Kubernetes integration](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues/260)
This functionality is undocumented and not yet ready for general use. However,
we consider it to be at Alpha stage and suitable for adventurous early adopters
to try out.

<!--truncate-->

We consider Kubernetes integration to be extremely important and we want to get
this right, so we'd love to [get feedback][urls.vector_chat] from anyone willing.

The main ticket to follow is [issue #260](https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues/260).
