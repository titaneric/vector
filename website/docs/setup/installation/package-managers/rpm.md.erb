Vector can be installed through the [RPM package manager][urls.rpm] which is

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Install

1.  Download the [Vector `.rpm file`][urls.vector_downloads.<%= metadata.latest_version %>/vector-x86_64.rpm]

    <Tabs
      className="mini"
      defaultValue="latest"
      values={[
        { label: 'Latest (<%= metadata.latest_version %>)', value: 'latest'},
        { label: 'Nightly', value: 'nightly'},
      ]}>

    <TabItem value="latest">

    ```bash
    curl -O [[[urls.vector_downloads.<%= metadata.latest_version %>/vector-x86_64.rpm]]]
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="nightly">

    ```bash
    curl -O [[[urls.vector_downloads.nightly/latest/vector-x86_64.rpm]]]
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2.  Install the Vector `.rpm` package directly:

    ```bash
    sudo rpm -i vector-x86_64.rpm
    ```

3.  Start Vector:

    ```

    That's it! Proceed to [configure](#configuring) Vector for your use case.
