Vector can be installed through the [DPKG package manager][urls.dpkg] which is
generally used on Debian and Ubuntu systems.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Install

1.  Download the [Vector `.deb file`][urls.vector_downloads.0.5.0/vector-amd64.deb]:

    <Tabs
      className="mini"
      defaultValue="latest"
      values={[
        { label: 'Latest (0.5.0)', value: 'latest'},
        { label: 'Nightly', value: 'nightly'},
      ]}>

    <TabItem value="latest">

    ```bash
    curl -O https://packages.timber.io/vector/0.5.0/vector-amd64.deb
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="nightly">

    ```bash
    curl -O https://packages.timber.io/vector/nightly/latest/vector-amd64.deb
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2.  Install the Vector `.deb` package directly:

    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i vector-amd64.deb
    ```

3.  Start Vector:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start vector
    ```

    That's it! Proceed to [configure](#configuring) Vector for your use case.
