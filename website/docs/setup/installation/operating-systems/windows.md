Vector can be installed on Windows through the following methods:

import Jump from '@site/src/components/Jump';

<Jump to="/docs/setup/installation/manual/from-archives?os=windows_x86_64">
  <i className="feather icon-terminal"></i> Install From an Archive <span class="badge badge--primary">recommended</span>
</Jump>

Alternatively, you can build Vector from source:

<Jump to="/docs/setup/installation/manual/from-source" size="sm">
  <i className="feather icon-terminal"></i> Install From Source
</Jump>
