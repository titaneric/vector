Sources are responsible for ingesting [events][docs.data-model#event] into
Vector, they can both receive and pull in data. If you're deploying Vector in
an [agent role][docs.roles.agent], you'll want to user local data sources
like the [`file`][docs.sources.file] or [`stdin`][docs.sources.stdin] sources.
If you're deploying Vector in a [service role][docs.roles.service], you'll want
to use sources that receive data over the network, like the
[`vector`][docs.sources.vector], [`socket`][docs.sources.socket], and
[`syslog`][docs.sources.syslog] sources.
