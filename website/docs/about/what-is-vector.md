Vector is a [high-performance][pages.index#performance],
[open-source][urls.vector_repo] monitoring and observability data router. It
makes [collecting][docs.sources], [transforming][docs.transforms], and
[sending][docs.sinks] logs, metrics and events easy. It decouples data
collection from your services, giving you data ownership and control, among
many other benefits.

Built in [Rust][urls.rust], Vector places high-value on
[performance][pages.index#performance], [correctness][pages.index#correctness],
and [operator friendliness][docs.administration]. It compiles to a single static
binary and is designed to be [deployed][docs.deployment] across your entire
infrastructure, serving both as a light-weight [agent][docs.roles.agent] and a
highly efficient [service][docs.roles.service], making it the single tool you
need to get data from A to B.
