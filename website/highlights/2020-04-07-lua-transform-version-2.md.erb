This is an exciting one! v2 of our [`lua` transform][docs.transforms.lua] has
been released. It contains an entirely new API for using Lua within Vector,
unblocking some very important limitations that our v1 (MVP) contained:

1. Correct data model and type conversions.
2. Introduction of hooks to maintain global state.
3. Introduction of timers to facilitate timed flushing. Useful for aggregations.
4. The ability to accept and work with metrics data.

This raises the bar in terms of capabilities, which is important! Lua is often
used as an escape hatch when Vector's native transforms are not flexible enough.

Did you know we're [working on a WASM integration][urls.pr_2006] ðŸ‘€

## Example

Here's an example demonstrating how to create aggregations form your log data:

```toml title="vector.toml"
[transforms.aggregator]
type = "lua"
version = "2"
inputs = [] # add names of the input components here
hooks.init = "init"
hooks.process = "process"
hooks.shutdown = "shutdown"
timers = [{interval_seconds = 5, handler = "timer_handler"}]

source = """
  function init()
    count = 0
  end

  function process()
    count = count + 1
  end

  function timer_handler(emit)
    emit(make_counter(counter))
    counter = 0
  end

  function shutdown(emit)
    emit(make_counter(counter))
  end

  function make_counter(value)
    return metric = {
      name = "event_counter",
      kind = "incremental",
      timestamp = os.date("!*t"),
      counter = {
        value = value
      }
    }
  end
"""
```
