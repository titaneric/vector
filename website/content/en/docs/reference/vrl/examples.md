Here you'll find a comprehensive list of all VRL program examples. These
examples demonstrate the breadth of the language and its observability-focused
facilities.

## Try Using The REPL

You can run these examples using the **VRL REPL** (Read–eval–print loop).

Assuming you have Vector installed, you can run `vector vrl` to start the REPL.
From there, you can type `help` and press return to get further help.

The REPL behaves nearly identical to the programs you write for your Vector
configuration, and can be used to test individual snippets of complex programs
before you commit them to your production configuration.

The `vector vrl` command has many other capabilities, run the command using
`vector vrl --help` to see more information.
