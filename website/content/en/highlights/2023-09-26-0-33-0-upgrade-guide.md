## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Behavior of the `datadog_logs` sink's `endpoint` setting {#datadog-logs-endpoint}

The `endpoint` configuration setting is common to each of the Datadog sinks. Before this
change, when `endpoint` was set, the logs sink took the provided endpoint as the complete
URL (including API path) to use for posting HTTP requests. This behavior is inconsistent
with the other Datadog sinks, which use the `endpoint` as a base URL that the API path
(eg. "/api/v2/logs"), is appended to.

With this release, the `datadog_logs` sink's behavior is now consistent with the other
Datadog sinks for the `endpoint` setting.


### Deprecations

#### Renaming the `armv7` rpm package {#armv7-rename}

The `armv7` rpm package, `vector-<version>-1.armv7.rpm`, is now published as
`vector-<version>-1.armv7hl.rpm` to better follow rpm guidelines. The `armv7`
package will be no longer be published beginning in the 0.34.0 release.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Async runtime default number of worker threads {#runtime-worker-threads}

We've changed the default number of worker threads spawned by Vector's async runtime
from being the number of CPUs on the host machine to the value returned by
[`std::thread::available_parallelism()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/fn.available_parallelism.html).
This should be a better default value for containerized environments where the container
has limited quotas, but note this change may impact performance.

The number of worker threads used can be seen by enabling debug logging, and the value can
be overriden by setting the `VECTOR_THREADS` environment variable.
