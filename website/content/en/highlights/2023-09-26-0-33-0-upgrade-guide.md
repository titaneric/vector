Vector's 0.33.0 release includes **deprecations**:

1. [Renaming the `armv7` rpm package](#armv7-rename)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Deprecations

#### Renaming the `armv7` rpm package {#armv7-rename}

The `armv7` rpm package, `vector-<version>-1.armv7.rpm`, is now published as
`vector-<version>-1.armv7hl.rpm` to better follow rpm guidelines. The `armv7`
package will be no longer be published beginning in the 0.34.0 release.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Async runtime default number of worker threads {#runtime-worker-threads}

We've changed the default number of worker threads spawned by Vector's async runtime
from being the number of CPUs on the host machine to the value returned by
[`std::thread::available_parallelism()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/thread/fn.available_parallelism.html).
This should be a better default value for containerized environments where the container
has limited quotas, but note this change may impact performance.

The number of worker threads used can be seen by enabling debug logging, and the value can
be overriden by setting the `VECTOR_THREADS` environment variable.
