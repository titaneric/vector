We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### The `journald` source's `units` option removed {#journald-units}

The `units` option had been replaced by `include_units` in the `0.10` release. This release marks the final removal
of this option, please update your configurations to use the `include_units` option instead.

#### Removal metadata functions {#metadata-functions-removal}

Vector `0.25.0` introduced new metadata path syntax available in VRL which points
directly to event metadata. That meant the metadata functions were no longer necessary and
were deprecated. They are now being removed. The table below shows you how to convert
VRL code from the method calls to the new path syntax. If you are running Vector `0.25.0`
or later, you will also receive warnings which will provide you with the correct
syntax to use to migrate.

|        | before                                | after              |
|--------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| get    | get_metadata_field(.foo.bar)          | %foo.bar           |
| set    | set_metadata_field(.foo.bar, "value") | %foo.bar = "value" |
| delete | remove_metadata_field(.foo.bar)       | del(%foo.bar)      |

### Deprecation notices

#### The `redis` sink's `url` argument changed to `endpoint` {#redis-endpoint}

To maintain consistent naming with other Vector sinks, the `url` option in the
`redis` sink has been renamed to `endpoint`. `url` will still work, but has
been deprecated and will be removed in due course.

#### The `aws_s3` source's `strategy` option has been hidden {#aws_s3-strategy}

The `strategy` option has been hidden on the documentation for the `aws_s3` source.
`sqs` is currently the only value for this option, and is currently the default. If
additional strategies are added for this source, we will expose this option again.
No changes need to be made by users of this source, it is a documentation only change.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### AWS components now use OpenSSL as the TLS implementation {#aws-openssl}

In this release, Vector's AWS integrations had their TLS implementation swapped from
[`rustls`][rusttls] to OpenSSL. We don't expect any user visible impact,
but [please let us know][bug_report] if this change causes you any issues.

We made this change primarily since most of Vector's dependencies use OpenSSL and so it reduces our
maintenance burden caused by any variances in the implementation. We may re-evaluate in the future
as more of the Rust ecosystem supports `rustls`.
