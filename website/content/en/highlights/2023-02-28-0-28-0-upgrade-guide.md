Vector's 0.28.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [The `journald` source's `units` option removed](#journald-units)

and **deprecations**:

1. [The `redis` sink's `url` argument changed to `endpoint`](#redis-endpoint)

and **potentially impactful changes**:

1. [AWS components now use OpenSSL as the TLS implementation](#aws-openssl)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### The `journald` source's `units` option removed {#journald-units}

The `units` option had been replaced by `include_units` in the `0.10` release. This release marks the final removal
of this option, please update your configurations to use the `include_units` option instead.

### Deprecation notices

#### The `redis` sink's `url` argument changed to `endpoint` {#redis-endpoint}

To maintain consistent naming with other Vector sinks, the `url` option in the
`redis` sink has been renamed to `endpoint`. `url` will still work, but has
been deprecated and will be removed in due course.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### AWS components now use OpenSSL as the TLS implementation {#aws-openssl}

In this release, Vector's AWS integrations had their TLS implementation swapped from
[`rustls`][rusttls] to OpenSSL. We don't expect any user visible impact,
but [please let us know][bug_report] if this change causes you any issues.

We made this change primarily since most of Vector's dependencies use OpenSSL and so it reduces our
maintenance burden caused by any variances in the implementation. We may re-evaluate in the future
as more of the Rust ecosystem supports `rustls`.
