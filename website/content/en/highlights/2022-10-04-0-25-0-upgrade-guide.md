## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of VRL's modulo operator {#modulo-removal}

VRL's modulo operator (`%`) was deprecated in `0.24.0` and has now been removed. The `mod` function
can be used instead.

Before:

```coffee
5 % 2 == 1
```

After:

```cofee
mod(5, 2) == 1
```

#### `internal_metrics` defaults to setting `host` tag {#internal-metrics-host-tag}

The `internal_metrics` source now defaults to setting the host tag on emitted metrics. This behavior
avoids issues when deploying multiple Vector instances publishing their metrics to the same sink
without opting into this tag via `tags.host_key`. The default key for this is the configured
`log_schema.host_key` (which defaults to `host`).

This behavior can be opted out of by setting `tags.host_key = ""` on the `internal_metrics` source.

### Deprecation Notices

None
