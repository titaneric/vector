## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of VRL's modulo operator {#modulo-removal}

VRL's modulo operator (`%`) was deprecated in `0.24.0` and has now been removed. The `mod` function
can be used instead.

Before:

```coffee
5 % 2 == 1
```

After:

```cofee
mod(5, 2) == 1
```

#### Removal of the `new_relic_logs` sink {#new-relic-logs-sink-removal}

In 0.24.0, we [announced][0-24-0-upgrade-guide] that the `new_relic_logs` sink had been deprecated,
and that users should prefer to use the `new_relic` sink instead, which has support not only for
logs, but also metrics and traces.  Switching from `new_relic_logs` to `new_relic` is not as simple
as just changing the sink type field, but it only involves a few small changes which we'll cover
below.

First, you'll have to change the `type` from `new_relic_logs` to `new_relic`. As well, you'll have
to set a field, `api`, to specify that you're sending logs. The value of this field should `"logs"`.

Lastly, you'll need to tweak the credentials used to specify your New Relic account credentials.
With the `new_relic_logs` sink, you had the option to specify either your [Insights insert
key][nr_insights_key] (`insert_key`) or your [License key][nr_license_key] (`license_key`). With the
`new_relic` sink, you can no longer use an Insights insert key, and must use a license key.
Additionally, the [account ID][nr_account_id] must also now be specified.

All put together, here's an example of converting from a `new_relic_logs` sink configuration over to
the `new_relic` sink configuration:

```toml
[sinks.new_relic_logs]
type = "new_relic_logs"
license_key = "xxxx"

[sinks.new_relic]
type = "new_relic"
license_key = "xxxx"
account_id = "yyyy"
api = "logs"
```

[nr_account_id]: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id/

#### `internal_metrics` defaults to setting `host` tag {#internal-metrics-host-tag}

The `internal_metrics` source now defaults to setting the host tag on emitted metrics. This behavior
avoids issues when deploying multiple Vector instances publishing their metrics to the same sink
without opting into this tag via `tags.host_key`. The default key for this is the configured
`log_schema.host_key` (which defaults to `host`).

This behavior can be opted out of by setting `tags.host_key = ""` on the `internal_metrics` source.

#### Removal of the `vector` source and sink v1 protocol {#vector-v1-removal}

The original v1 protocol of the `vector` source and sink was [marked as deprecated in version
0.20.0][deprecate-vector-v1]. This version removes support for the deprecated protocol and its
configuration. The `version` field is still accepted in configurations, but only version numbered
`2` is accepted.

[deprecate-vector-v1] https://vector.dev/highlights/2022-02-08-0-20-0-upgrade-guide/#deprecate-v1

#### Removal of `shutdown_timeout_secs` from `vector` source {#shutdown-timeout-secs}

The `shutdown_timeout_secs` config for the `vector` v2 source didn't actually do anything, so
it was removed.

### Deprecation Notices

#### Deprecation of VRL metadata functions {#metadata-function-deprecation}

Vector `0.25.0` has introduced a new metadata path syntax available in VRL which points
directly to event metadata. This means the metadata functions are no longer necessary and
will be removed in the future.

|        | before                                | after              |
|--------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|
| get    | get_metadata_field(.foo.bar)          | %foo.bar           |
| set    | set_metadata_field(.foo.bar, "value") | %foo.bar = "value" |
| delete | remove_metadata_field(.foo.bar)       | del(%foo.bar)      |


#### Deprecation of `endpoint` option in Elasticsearch sink

Vector `0.25.0` has introduced distribution of events to multiple endpoints for Elasticsearch sink.
In order to enable this distribution, a new `endpoints` setting has been introduced which configures one or more destinations to which to distribute the events.
The existing `endpoint` setting is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
