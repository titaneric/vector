Vector's 0.24.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [VRL rejects querying non-collection types on assignment](#vrl-query-assignment)
2. [Metric bucket counts are now u64](#metric-buckets)
3. [`codec` field on sink `encoding` must be specified explicitly](#sink-encoding-codec)
4. [`ndjson` on sink `encoding` is now `json` encoding + `newline_delimited` framing](#sink-encoding-json)
5. [VRL type definition updates](#vrl-type-def)

and **deprecations**:

1. [`internal_metrics` source cardinality metric change]

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### VRL rejects querying non-collection types on assignment {#vrl-query-assignment}

Previously, the following would work:

```coffee
foo = 42
foo.bar = 3.14
```

This is now rejected, and instead returns a compiler error:

```text
error[E642]: parent path segment rejects this mutation
  ┌─ :1:5
  │
1 │ foo.bar = 3.14
  │ --- ^^^ querying a field of a non-object type is unsupported
  │ │
  │ this path resolves to a value of type integer
  │
  = try: change parent value to object, before assignment
  =
  =     foo = {}
  =     foo.bar = 3.14
  =
  = see documentation about error handling at https://errors.vrl.dev/#handling
  = see language documentation at https://vrl.dev
```

This change was made to prevent accidentally overwriting non-collection types.
As the diagnostic message suggests, you can still achieve the desired result by
first re-writing the non-collection type to a collection type (`foo = {}`), and
then mutating the collection itself.

This change applies to both objects and arrays, so this example is also
disallowed:

```coffee
foo = 42
foo[0] = 3.14
```

#### Metric bucket counts are now u64 {#metric-buckets}

The field storing metric bucket counts for Histogram metrics has now been upgraded
to use 64 bits from 32 bits. This allows for much larger bucket sizes to be used. To
facilitate this we have updated the proto files that determine how an event is
persisted. Newer versions of Vector will be able to read older versions of metrics,
but older versions of Vector may not be able to read newer versions of metrics.

This has two potential implications that you should consider.

1. Disk buffers should be backed up if you want to be able to roll back to an older
   Vector version since new disk buffer entries may not be readable by older Vector
   versions. The disk buffers location can be found under the
   [Vector data directory](/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#data_dir).

2. When upgrading Vector to Vector communication (the `vector` source and sink or
   the `native` codec) make sure you upgrade the consumers first followed by the
   producers to ensure newer versions of Vector aren't sending data to older
   versions, which may not be able to be read.

#### `codec` field on sink `encoding` must be specified explicitly {#sink-encoding-codec}

Setting the `encoding` value on a sink by a string has been deprecated in
`0.23.0` and is removed in this release. To migrate have a look at the
[upgrade guide for deprecated shorthand values for `encoding` options](/highlights/2022-07-07-0-23-0-upgrade-guide/#deprecated-encoding-shorthand).

#### `ndjson` on sink `encoding` is now `json` encoding + `newline_delimited` framing {#sink-encoding-json}

The `ndjson` sink `encoding` value has been deprecated in `0.23.0` and is
removed in this release. To migrate have a look at the
[upgrade guide for the `ndjson` sink `encoding` value](/highlights/2022-07-07-0-23-0-upgrade-guide/#sink-encoding-ndjson-json).

#### VRL type definition updates {#vrl-type-def}

There were many situations where VRL didn't calculate the correct type
definition. These are now fixed. In some cases this can cause compilation
errors when upgrading if the code relied on the previous (incorrect) behavior.

The best way to fix these issues is to let the compiler guide you through the problems, it will usually
provide suggestions on how to fix the issue. Please give us feedback if you think any error diagnostics could
be improved, we are continually trying to improve them.

The most common error you will probably see is the fallibility of a function changed because the type of one of the
parameters changed.

For example, if you are trying to `split` a string, but the input could now be null, the error would look like this

```text
error[E110]: invalid argument type
  ┌─ :1:7
  │
1 │ split(msg, " ")
  │       ^^^
  │       │
  │       this expression resolves to one of string or null
  │       but the parameter "value" expects the exact type string
  │
  = try: ensuring an appropriate type at runtime
  =
  =     msg = string!(msg)
  =     split(msg, " ")
  =
  = try: coercing to an appropriate type and specifying a default value as a fallback in case coercion fails
  =
  =     msg = to_string(msg) ?? "default"
  =     split(msg, " ")
  =
  = see documentation about error handling at https://errors.vrl.dev/#handling
  = learn more about error code 110 at https://errors.vrl.dev/110
  = see language documentation at https://vrl.dev
  = try your code in the VRL REPL, learn more at https://vrl.dev/examples

```

As suggested, you have a few options to solve errors like this.

1. Abort if the arguments aren't the right type by appending the function name with `!`, such as `to_string!(msg)`
2. Force the type to be a string, using the `string` function. This function will error at runtime if the value isn't
   the expected type. You can call it as `string!` to abort if it's not the right type.
3. Provide a default value if the function fails using the "error coalescing" operator (`??`), such as `to_string(msg) ?? "default"`
4. Handle the error manually by capturing both the return value and possible error, such as `result, err = to_string(msg)`

### Deprecation Notices

#### `internal_metrics` source cardinality metric change

The `internal_metrics` source has been emitting a metric indicating the number of distinct metrics
in its internal registry. This currently has the name `internal_metrics_cardinality_total` and is a
counter type metric.

With the introduction of the capability of expiring metrics from the internal registry, it is no
longer accurate to call this a counter as its value may fluctuate during the running of vector. As
such, a new metric called `internal_metrics_cardinality` of type gauge has been added. The existing
metric described above is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

See the
[documentation](/docs/reference/configuration/sources/internal_metrics/#internal_metrics_cardinality)
for additional details.
