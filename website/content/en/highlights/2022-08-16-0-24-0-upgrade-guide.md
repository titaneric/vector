Vector's 0.24.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [VRL rejects querying non-collection types on assignment](#vrl-query-assignment)
2. [Metric bucket counts are now u64](#metric-buckets)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### [VRL rejects querying non-collection types on assignment] {#vrl-query-assignment}

Previously, the following would work:

```coffee
foo = 42
foo.bar = 3.14
```

This is now rejected, and instead returns a compiler error:

```text
error[E642]: parent path segment rejects this mutation
  ┌─ :1:5
  │
1 │ foo.bar = 3.14
  │ --- ^^^ querying a field of a non-object type is unsupported
  │ │
  │ this path resolves to a value of type integer
  │
  = try: change parent value to object, before assignment
  =
  =     foo = {}
  =     foo.bar = 3.14
  =
  = see documentation about error handling at https://errors.vrl.dev/#handling
  = see language documentation at https://vrl.dev
```

This change was made to prevent accidentally overwriting non-collection types.
As the diagnostic message suggests, you can still achieve the desired result by
first re-writing the non-collection type to a collection type (`foo = {}`), and
then mutating the collection itself.

This change applies to both objects and arrays, so this example is also
disallowed:

```coffee
foo = 42
foo[0] = 3.14
```

#### [Metric bucket counts are now u64] {#metric-buckets}

The field storing metric bucket counts for Histogram metrics has now been upgraded
to use 64 bits from 32 bits. This allows for much larger bucket sizes to be used. To
facilitate this we have updated the proto files that determine how an event is
persisted. Newer versions of Vector will be able to read older versions of metrics,
but older versions of Vector may not be able to read newer versions of metrics.

This has two potential implications that you should consider.

1. Disk buffers should be backed up if you want to be able to roll back to an older
   Vector version since new disk buffer entries may not be readable by older Vector
   versions. The disk buffers location can be found under the
   [Vector data directory](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#data_dir).

2. When upgrading Vector to Vector communication (the `vector` source and sink or
   the `native` codec) make sure you upgrade the consumers first followed by the
   producers to ensure newer versions of Vector aren't sending data to older
   versions, which may not be able to be read.
