We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

### Breaking changes

#### [VRL rejects querying non-collection types on assignment] {#vrl-query-assignment}

Previously, the following would work:

```coffee
foo = 42
foo.bar = 3.14
```

This is now rejected, and instead returns a compiler error:

```text
error[E642]: parent path segment rejects this mutation
  ┌─ :1:5
  │
1 │ foo.bar = 3.14
  │ --- ^^^ querying a field of a non-object type is unsupported
  │ │
  │ this path resolves to a value of type integer
  │
  = try: change parent value to object, before assignment
  =
  =     foo = {}
  =     foo.bar = 3.14
  =
  = see documentation about error handling at https://errors.vrl.dev/#handling
  = see language documentation at https://vrl.dev
```

This change was made to prevent accidentally overwriting non-collection types.
As the diagnostic message suggests, you can still achieve the desired result by
first re-writing the non-collection type to a collection type (`foo = {}`), and
then mutating the collection itself.

This change applies to both objects and arrays, so this example is also
disallowed:

```coffee
foo = 42
foo[0] = 3.14
```
