## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Change to set expiration behavior in `prometheus_exporter` sink {#prom-exporter-set-expiration}

As part of work to better control memory growth in the `prometheus_exporter` sink, we've done some
work to ensure that metric expiration behavior is consistent for all metrics.  Instead of reporting
a count of zero when they expire, sets will now stop reporting entirely when they expire and are
flushed.

Due to how the `prometheus_exporter` sink works, Vector must store a snapshot of the state of all
metrics: the latest value of a counter or a gauge, and so on.  Sets represent a list of unique
values, and these values can be anything from integer to strings, which over time, can grow quite
large.  To combatg memory growth, we "expire" metrics from the sink if they have not been updated
within the time window configured by `flush_period_secs`.

For all metrics besides sets, we would delete the metric from the internal state and stop reporting
it.  For sets, however, we would simply clear their values and thus report a set size of zero.  This
behavior was not consistent with how we expired other metric types, and additionally, could still
lead to a growth of unique series in a scrape, over time, as we would clear the set but not stop
reporting it.
