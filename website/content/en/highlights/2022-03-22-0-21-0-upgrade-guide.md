## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Deprecated GraphQL API subscriptions have been removed {#removed-deprecated-subscriptions}

The following deprecated subscriptions have been removed in this release. Please
use the listed alternatives.

- `eventsInTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `eventsOutTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsInThroughputs`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsInTotals`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsOutThroughputs`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsOutTotals`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `eventsInThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `eventsOutThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`

### Deprecations

#### `receivedEventsTotal`, `sentEventsTotal`, `sentEventsThroughput`, `receivedEventsThroughput` subscriptions have been deprecated {#deprecate-aggregate-subscriptions}

While these subscriptions were intended to display aggregate metrics across all
components, they currently only show a per-component metric and are made
redundant by more informative subscriptions that include specific component
information. To avoid misuse and confusion, we are deprecating them in favor of
the following alternatives.

- `receivedEventsTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `receivedEventsThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
