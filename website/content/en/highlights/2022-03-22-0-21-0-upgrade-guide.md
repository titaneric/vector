## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Syntax changes for non-VRL paths {#path-syntax-changes}

Previously, there were two different ways to describe paths. VRL uses a newer syntax, while everything
else in Vector still used an older syntax. This was a constant pain point for users,
and we have taken some steps to migrate towards the VRL syntax. This is a **breaking change** that may require migration.

The old syntax was very lenient in the characters that were allowed in a field name. It also supported single character escapes.
The new syntax only allows `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ @`. Any other character will require the field name to be quoted.
Quotes around a field name replace single character escaping. This brings the old syntax in line with the newer (VRL) syntax. Note that
VRL makes a distinction between a field starting with a "." (event query) and without (variable query). Outside a VRL context,
the "." is optional and ignored.

Migration will be required for any paths used outside a VRL context. That is any transform (except remap and conditions), templating,
and any source or sink referencing field names. There are _no_ changes to the VRL syntax.

Here are some examples that require migrating

| old syntax | new syntax | comment |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| foo\\.bar.baz     | "foo.bar".baz     | The `.` field separator needs to be escaped if used as part of a field name. The old syntax allowed individual character escaping. The new syntax requires quotes around the field name.
| headers.User-Agent | headers."User-Agent" | `-` requires quotes with the new syntax
| foo with spaces | "foo with spaces" | Spaces also need to be quoted
| foo\\"bar | "foo\\"bar" | Double quotes and backlashes must be escaped _inside_ quotes


### TOML transform example

Old syntax

```toml
[transforms.dedupe]
type = "dedupe"
inputs = ["input"]
fields.match = ["message.user-identifier"]
```

New syntax (the dash requires the field name to be quoted)

```toml
[transforms.dedupe]
type = "dedupe"
inputs = ["input"]
fields.match = ["message.\"user-identifier\""]
```

For more information on the new syntax, you can review the documentation [here](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/vrl/expressions/#path)



#### GraphQL API `outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns` subscription argument `patterns` changed to `outputsPatterns` {#api-patterns-to-outputspatterns}

To avoid confusion and align with the new `inputsPatterns` argument, we've
renamed the original `patterns` argument to `outputsPatterns`. `outputsPatterns`
allows you to specify patterns that will match against components (sources,
transforms) and display their _outflowing_ events. `inputsPatterns` allows you
to specify patterns that match against components (transforms, sinks) and
display their _incoming_ events.

Note that using an input pattern to match a component is effectively a
shorthand. It's the same as using one or more output patterns to match against
all the outputs flowing into a component.

Updating your subscriptions is as simple as renaming `patterns` to
`outputsPatterns`.

```diff
- subscription {
-  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(patterns: [...])
+ subscription {
+  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(outputsPatterns: [...])
```

#### GraphQL API `EventNotification` type changes {#api-event-notification-changes}

As part of adding a new notification (`InvalidMatch`) to warn users against
attempting invalid matches, we've reshaped the `EventNotification` type for
easier querying and future extensibility.

Previously, the `EventNotification` type consisted simply of a `pattern` and
plain enum describing the notification.

```graphql
type EventNotification {
  pattern: String!
  notification: EventNotificationType!
}
```

While this worked well for simple notifications like `Matched` and `NotMatched`,
it was awkward to extend to new notifications, like `InvalidMatch`, which may
want to include more information than `pattern`. Thus, the new
`EventNotification` type takes the following form:

```graphql
type EventNotification {
  notification: Notification!
  message: String!
}
```

where `Notification` is a union of specific kinds of notifications:

```graphql
union Notification = Matched | NotMatched | InvalidMatch
```

`message` is a new human-readable description of the notification while
`notification` contains additional details specific to the kind of notification.
All the same information is still available, and the following example shows how
you might convert an existing query to the new schema.

```diff
 subscription {
-   outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(patterns: [...]) {
+   outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(outputsPatterns: [...]) {
     __typename
     ... on EventNotification {
-       pattern
-       notification
+       message
+       notification {
+         __typename
+         ... on Matched {
+           pattern
+         }
+         ... on NotMatched {
+           pattern
+         }
+         ... on InvalidMatch {
+           pattern
+           invalidMatches
+         }
+       }
      }
     }
   }
 }
```

#### Deprecated GraphQL API subscriptions have been removed {#removed-deprecated-subscriptions}

The following deprecated subscriptions have been removed in this release. Please
use the listed alternatives.

- `eventsInTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `eventsOutTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsInThroughputs`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsInTotals`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsOutThroughputs`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsOutTotals`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `eventsInThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `eventsOutThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`

#### The `vector vrl` timezone flag `-tz` is now `-z` {#vector-vrl-timezone}

We upgraded the Vector CLI to use [Clap v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), a
popular Rust crate.

A breaking change in Clap v3 is that shortened CLI flags now use the `char`
type, meaning they are restricted to single characters.

As a consequence, the shortened form of our `vector vrl --timezone` flag
(previously `--tz`) has been updated to the more succinct `-z`.

#### The `vector top` human_metrics short flag `-h` is now `-H` {#vector-top-human-metrics}

To avoid clashing and issues with our upgrade to [Clap
v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), the short `-h` from `--help` and `-h` from
`--human_metrics` in the `vector top` command have been disambiguated. The
shortened form for `--human_metrics` is now `-H` and `-h` is reserved for
`--help`.

#### Remainder operator (%) in VRL is fallible {#remainder-fallible}

The remainder operator in VRL has become a fallible operation. This is because
finding the remainder with a divisor of zero can raise an error that needs to
be handled.

Before this VRL would compile:

```coffee
.remainder = 50 % .value
```

If `.value` was zero, Vector would panic. This can be fixed by handling the error:

```coffee
.remainder = 50 % .value ?? 0
```

#### AWS SDK Migration {#aws-sdk-migration}

We are in the process of migrating sources and sinks that utilize AWS to the official AWS SDK (from Rusoto).
This comes with some benefits such as support for IMDSv2. This requires us to deprecate some config options.

If you were providing a custom path to an AWS credentials file, this is no longer supported for components that have
been migrated. It is still possible to use a credentials file, but it should be placed in the default location (`~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, OS X, and Unix; `%userprofile%\.aws\credentials` on Microsoft Windows), or
the location should be set with an environment variable (`AWS_CONFIG_FILE` or `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`).

Specifying a region is now also required. Make sure a region is specified in either the AWS config file, or the Vector config.

The `assume_role` config option was deprecated and moved to `auth.assume_role` previously. This deprecated option has
now been removed.

This affects the following components:

- AWS Cloudwatch Metrics Sink
- AWS Cloudwatch Logs Sink
- AWS SQS Source (this was migrated in a previous version)
- AWS SQS Sink
- AWS Kinesis Streams Sink
- AWS S3 Sink
- Datadog Archives Sink (s3 config only)

For more details on configuring auth, you can visit these links:

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/credentials.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/environment-variables.html

#### Route transform metric `event_discarded_total` removed {#transform-route-metric}

Until now, when using the `route` transform, if an event didn't match any configured route, this event would be
discarded and lost for the following transforms and sinks.

A new `_unmatched` route has now been introduced and the events are no longer discarded, making the `event_discarded_total` metric irrelevant so it has been dropped.

You can still get the total number of events that match no routes via `component_events_sent_total` with a tag of `output=_unmatched`.

### Deprecations

#### `receivedEventsTotal`, `sentEventsTotal`, `sentEventsThroughput`, `receivedEventsThroughput` subscriptions have been deprecated {#deprecate-aggregate-subscriptions}

While these subscriptions were intended to display aggregate metrics across all
components, they currently only show a per-component metric and are made
redundant by more informative subscriptions that include specific component
information. To avoid misuse and confusion, we are deprecating them in favor of
the following alternatives.

- `receivedEventsTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `receivedEventsThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
