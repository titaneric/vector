Vector's 0.21.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [GraphQL API outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns subscription argument `patterns` changed to `outputsPatterns`](#api-patterns-to-outputspatterns)
2. [Deprecated GraphQL API subscriptions have been removed](#removed-deprecated-subscriptions)
3. [The `vector vrl` timezone flag `-tz` is now `-z`](#vector-vrl-timezone)
4. [The `vector top` human_metrics flag `-h` is now `-H`](#vector-top-human-metrics)

And **deprecations**:

1. [`receivedEventsTotal`, `sentEventsTotal`, `sentEventsThroughput`, `receivedEventsThroughput` subscriptions have been deprecated](#deprecate-aggregate-subscriptions)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### GraphQL API `outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns` subscription argument `patterns` changed to `outputsPatterns` {#api-patterns-to-outputspatterns}

To avoid confusion and align with the new `inputsPatterns` argument, we've
renamed the original `patterns` argument to `outputsPatterns`. `outputsPatterns`
allows you to specify patterns that will match against components (sources,
transforms) and display their _outflowing_ events. `inputsPatterns` allows you
to specify patterns that match against components (transforms, sinks) and
display their _incoming_ events.

Note that using an input pattern to match a component is effectively a
shorthand. It's the same as using one or more output patterns to match against
all the outputs flowing into a component.

Updating your subscriptions is as simple as renaming `patterns` to
`outputsPatterns`.

```diff
- subscription {
-  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(patterns: [...])
+ subscription {
+  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(outputsPatterns: [...])
```

#### Deprecated GraphQL API subscriptions have been removed {#removed-deprecated-subscriptions}

The following deprecated subscriptions have been removed in this release. Please
use the listed alternatives.

- `eventsInTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `eventsOutTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsInThroughputs`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsInTotals`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `componentEventsOutThroughputs`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `componentEventsOutTotals`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `eventsInThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
- `eventsOutThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`

#### The `vector vrl` timezone flag `-tz` is now `-z` {#vector-vrl-timezone}

We upgraded the Vector CLI to use [Clap v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), a
popular Rust crate.

A breaking change in Clap v3 is that shortened CLI flags now use the `char`
type, meaning they are restricted to single characters.

As a consequence, the shortened form of our `vector vrl --timezone` flag
(previously `--tz`) has been updated to the more succinct `-z`.

#### The `vector top` human_metrics short flag `-h` is now `-H` {#vector-top-human-metrics}

To avoid clashing and issues with our upgrade to [Clap
v3](https://crates.io/crates/clap), the short `-h` from `--help` and `-h` from
`--human_metrics` in the `vector top` command have been disambiguated. The
shortened form for `--human_metrics` is now `-H` and `-h` is reserved for
`--help`.

### Deprecations

#### `receivedEventsTotal`, `sentEventsTotal`, `sentEventsThroughput`, `receivedEventsThroughput` subscriptions have been deprecated {#deprecate-aggregate-subscriptions}

While these subscriptions were intended to display aggregate metrics across all
components, they currently only show a per-component metric and are made
redundant by more informative subscriptions that include specific component
information. To avoid misuse and confusion, we are deprecating them in favor of
the following alternatives.

- `receivedEventsTotal`: use `componentReceivedEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsTotal`: use `componentSentEventsTotals`
- `sentEventsThroughput`: use `componentSentEventsThroughputs`
- `receivedEventsThroughput`: use `componentReceivedEventsThroughputs`
