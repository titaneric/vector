Vector's 0.27.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [`statsd` components now support enhanced metric tags](#statsd-enhanced-metrics)

and **potentially impactful changes**:

1. [Increase in possible tags sent with `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink](#increase-possible-tags)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### `statsd` components now supports enhanced metric tags {#statsd-enhanced-metrics}

Prior to this release, the `statsd` source parsed incoming empty tags (tags with a key
but no value), as having a boolean value "true". For example, in the tagset
"atag,btag:bvalue" , the tag "atag" would be parsed to a value of "true".
With this release, that behavior is now changed and the `statsd` source parses empty tags
as empty tags.

Similarly, prior to this release, the `statsd` sink encoded metric tags with a boolean value
of "true", to being an empty tag.
With this release, the `statsd` sink now correctly encodes a value or "true" to "true", and
empty tags as empty tags.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Increase in possible tags sent with `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink {#increase-possible-tags}

Before this release, the `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink would only send up to ten
tags to AWS as metric dimensions. This limit has been increased to thirty based
on the [current documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Metric.html).

This could increase the cardinality of your metrics by including previously dropped tags.
The following VRL program would allow you to drop tags when there are more than ten,
maintaining the original behavior.

```coffeescript
count = 10
tags = {}
for_each(object!(.tags)) ->|key, value| {
    if count > 0 {
        count = count - 1
        tags = set!(tags, [key], value)
    }
}
.tags = tags
```
