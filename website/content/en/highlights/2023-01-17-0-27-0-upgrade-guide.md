## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Increase in possible tags sent with `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink {#increase-possible-tags}

Before this release, the `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink would only send up to ten
tags to AWS as metric dimensions. This limit has been increased to thirty based
on the [current documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Metric.html).

While not strictly a breaking change, this could increase the cardinality of your
metrics by including previously dropped tags.
