## Upgrade guide

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Increase in possible tags sent with `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink {#increase-possible-tags}

Before this release, the `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink would only send up to ten
tags to AWS as metric dimensions. This limit has been increased to thirty based
on the [current documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Metric.html).

This could increase the cardinality of your metrics by including previously dropped tags.
The following VRL program would allow you to drop tags when there are more than ten,
maintaining the original behavior.

```coffeescript
count = 10
tags = {}
for_each(object!(.tags)) ->|key, value| {
    if count > 0 {
        count = count - 1
        tags = set!(tags, [key], value)
    }
}
.tags = tags
```
