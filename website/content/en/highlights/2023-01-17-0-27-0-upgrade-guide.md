Vector's 0.27.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [`statsd` components now support enhanced metric tags](#statsd-enhanced-metrics)
1. [Changes to `native` and `native_json` codecs](#vector-native-codecs)

and **potentially impactful changes**:

1. [Increase in possible tags sent with `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink](#increase-possible-tags)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### `statsd` components now supports enhanced metric tags {#statsd-enhanced-metrics}

Prior to this release, the `statsd` source parsed incoming empty tags (tags with a key
but no value), as having a boolean value "true". For example, in the tagset
"atag,btag:bvalue" , the tag "atag" would be parsed to a value of "true".
With this release, that behavior is now changed and the `statsd` source parses empty tags
as empty tags.

Similarly, prior to this release, the `statsd` sink encoded metric tags with a boolean value
of "true", to being an empty tag.
With this release, the `statsd` sink now correctly encodes a value or "true" to "true", and
empty tags as empty tags.

#### Changes to `native` and `native_json` codecs {#vector-native-codecs}

The `native` and `native_json` codecs have been modified to include support for enhanced tags (bare
tags or multi-valued tags) on metrics by optionally encoding tag values as arrays of values.  This
will cause Vector, when using these codecs and a metric source or transform that generates enhanced
tags, to emit metrics that are not backwards compatible with previous versions. Vector can continue
to load in events emitted by older versions.

This has two potential implications that you should consider:

1. Disk buffers should be backed up if you want to be able to roll back to an older Vector version
   since new disk buffer entries may not be readable by older Vector versions. The disk buffers
   location can be found under the
   [Vector data directory](/docs/reference/configuration/global-options/#data_dir).

2. When upgrading Vector to Vector communication using the `vector` source and sink or the `native`
   or `native_json` codecs, make sure you upgrade the consumers first followed by the producers to
   ensure newer versions of Vector aren't sending data to older versions, which may not be able to
   be read.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Increase in possible tags sent with `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink {#increase-possible-tags}

Before this release, the `aws_cloudwatch_metrics` sink would only send up to ten
tags to AWS as metric dimensions. This limit has been increased to thirty based
on the [current documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Metric.html).

This could increase the cardinality of your metrics by including previously dropped tags.
The following VRL program would allow you to drop tags when there are more than ten,
maintaining the original behavior.

```coffeescript
count = 10
tags = {}
for_each(object!(.tags)) ->|key, value| {
    if count > 0 {
        count = count - 1
        tags = set!(tags, [key], value)
    }
}
.tags = tags
```
