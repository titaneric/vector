Vector's 0.33.0 release includes **deprecations**:

1. [Default config location change](#default-config-location-change)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Deprecations

#### Default config location change {#default-config-location-change}

The default config location `/etc/vector/vector.toml` which is used by Vector `0.32.0` is now deprecated. This location will still be used in `0.33.0`. The new default path is `/etc/vector/vector.yaml`, please migrate to this new default path or specify the config path explicitly.

Vector `0.33.0` will attempt to load `/etc/vector/vector.toml` first, and if it is not present, it will fallback to `/etc/vector/vector.yaml`. However, Vector release `0.34.0` will automatically load `/etc/vector/vector.yaml` only.
