### Breaking changes

#### Removal of Deprecated Datadog Component Config Options {#datadog-deprecated-config-options}

The `region` config option has been removed from the Datadog Events, Logs,
and Metrics sinks. Instead the `site` option should be used.

The `region` and `application_key` config options have
been removed from the Enterprise configuration. Instead of `region`, `site` should be used. `application_key` is no longer required.
