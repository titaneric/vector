Vector's 0.32.0 release includes **deprecations**:

1. [VRL `to_timestamp` function](#deprecated-to-timestamp)

and **potentially impactful changes**:

1. [Upgrade of OpenSSL from 1.1.1 to 3.1](#openssl-upgrade)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Deprecations

#### VRL `to_timestamp` function {#deprecated-to-timestamp}

The `to_timestamp` function in VRL was deprecated. Instead, the following functions should be used:

- `parse_timestamp` to parse string timestamps
- `from_unix_timestamp` to parse integer timestamps

This removes some confusion that existed around "magic formats" that the `to_timestamp` had by
requiring string timestamp formats to be specified explicitly.

### Potentially impactful changes

#### Upgrade of OpenSSL from 1.1.1 to 3.1.0 {#openssl-upgrade}

As part of moving off of OpenSSL 1.1.1 before it becomes [end-of-life in
September](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/03/28/1.1.1-EOL/), Vector has upgraded the version
that it statically compiles in to 3.1.2. We don't anticipate any end-user impact from this change to
users of Vector, but [please let us know](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector/issues) if you see
any breakages resulting from this upgrade.
