Vector's 0.18.0 release includes two **breaking changes**:

1. [`batch.max_size` no longer valid for sinks](#batch-max-size)
2. [`request.in_flight_limit` no longer valid for sources and sinks](#request-in-flight-limit)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### `batch.max_size` no longer valid for sinks {#batch-max-size}

We've finally removed the `batch.max_size` parameter from sinks that support batching.  In the past,
this field allowed settings the maximum batch size in a general way, being interpreted by the sink
to mean either bytes or events.  As we add more and more sinks, some which support the notion of
batches being limited by both bytes and events, we've removed `max_size` as a way to ensure every
configuration is clear as to what is being limited rather than forcing users to dig into the
documentation to understand how the sink will interpret `max_size`.

If you're currently setting this, you will need to switch to either `batch.max_bytes` or
`batch.max_events`.  If you're trying to limit the size of the batch, in terms of bytes, you should
use `batch.max_bytes`.  Otherwise, if you're trying to limit the size of the batch in terms of
events, you should use `batch.max_events`.

### `request.in_flight_limit` no longer valid for sources and sinks

Similarly to `batch.max_size`, we've had support for adjusting the concurrency of sources and sinks
via `request.concurrency` for some time now.  This is the preferred field to set, and is referenced
in all of our documentation.

`request.concurrency` and `request.in_flight_limit` were both treated the same internally, so simply
renaming any instances of `request.in_flight_limit` in your configurations to `request.concurrency`
is enough to address this change.
