Vector's 0.22.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

1. [`gcp_stackdriver_metrics` configuration change](#stackdriver-metrics)

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### `gcp_stackdriver_metrics` configuration change {#stackdriver-metrics}

The `gcp_stackdriver_metrics` sink now matches the `gcp_stackdriver_logs`
configuration, and doesn't require an additional `labels` section to add
labels to submitted metrics.

### TOML transform example

Old configuration

```toml
[sinks.my_sink_id]
type = "gcp_stackdriver_metrics"
inputs = [ "my-source-or-transform-id" ]
credentials_path = "/path/to/credentials.json"
project_id = "vector-123456"

  [sinks.my_sink_id.resource]
  type = "global"

    [sinks.my_sink_id.resource.labels]
    projectId = "vector-123456"
    instanceId = "Twilight"
    zone = "us-central1-a"
```

New configuration

```toml
[sinks.my_sink_id]
type = "gcp_stackdriver_metrics"
inputs = [ "my-source-or-transform-id" ]
credentials_path = "/path/to/credentials.json"
project_id = "vector-123456"

  [sinks.my_sink_id.resource]
  type = "global"
  projectId = "vector-123456"
  instanceId = "Twilight"
  zone = "us-central1-a"
```
