					it marks itself as being "busy".
					Periodically, the source will poll all the active connections and will start a new stream
					if all the active streams are marked as busy and fewer than `max_concurrency` streams are
					active.
					Conversely, when a stream passes an idle interval (configured by the
					`idle_timeout_seconds` setting) with no traffic and no outstanding acknowledgements,
					it will drop the connection unless there are no other streams active.
					This combination of actions allows this source to respond dynamically to high load levels
