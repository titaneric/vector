			Key/value pairs representing mapped log field names and types.

			This is used to coerce log fields from strings into their proper types. The available types are listed in the `Types` list below.

			1. One of the built-in-formats listed in the `Timestamp Formats` table below.
			2. The [time format specifiers][chrono_fmt] from Rustâ€™s `chrono` library.
