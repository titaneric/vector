			Buffer configuration.

			Buffers are compromised of stages(*) that form a buffer _topology_, with input items being
			subject to configurable behavior when each stage reaches configured limits.  Buffers are
			configured for sinks, where backpressure from the sink can be handled by the buffer.  This
			allows absorbing temporary load, or potentially adding write-ahead-log behavior to a sink to
			increase the durability of a given Vector pipeline.

			While we use the term "buffer topology" here, a buffer topology is referred to by the more
			common "buffer" or "buffers" shorthand.  This is related to buffers originally being a single
			component, where you could only choose which buffer type to use.  As we expand buffer
			functionality to allow chaining buffers together, you'll see "buffer topology" used in internal
			documentation to correctly reflect the internal structure.
