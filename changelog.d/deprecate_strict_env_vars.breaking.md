The default of `--strict-env-vars` has been changed to `true`. This option has been deprecated. In
a future version it will be removed and Vector will have the behavior it currently has when set
to `true` which is that missing environment variables will cause Vector to fail to start up with an
error instead of a warning. Set `--strict-env-vars=false` to opt into deprecated behavior.
