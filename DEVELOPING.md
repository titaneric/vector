<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

## Prerequisites

1. **You are familiar with the [docs](https://docs.vector.dev).**
2. **You have read the [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.**
3. **You know about the [Vector community](https://vector.dev/community/),
   use this help.**

## Setup

1. Install Rust via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/):

   ```bash
   curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   ```

2. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/). Docker
   containers are used for mocking Vector's integrations.

3. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and
   [Bundler 2](https://bundler.io/v2.0/guides/bundler_2_upgrade.html).
   They are used to build Vector's documentation.

## Directory Structure

* [`/benches`](/benches) - Internal benchmarks.
* [`/config`](/config) - Public facing Vector config, included in releases.
* [`/distribution`](/distribution) - Distribution artifacts for various targets.
* [`/docs`](/docs) - https://docs.vector.dev source.
* [`/lib`](/lib) - External libraries that do not depend on `vector` but are used within the project.
* [`/proto`](/proto) - Protobuf definitions.
* [`/scripts`](/scripts) - Scripts used to generate docs and maintain the repo.
* [`/tests`](/tests) - Various high-level test cases.

## Makefile

Vector includes a [`Makefile`](/Makefile) that exposes top-level commands. Ex:

- `make test`
- `make build`
- `make check`
- `make run`
- `make bench`
- `make generate-docs`

The various commands are below within their respective sections.

### `make test`

This command will attempt to run `docker-compose up -d` then follow up with
`cargo test --features docker` command. Currently, it limits the test threads
to 4 as we spin up many `tokio` runtimes which sometimes causes fd limit
exceeded errors.

#### Sample Logs

We use `flog` to build a sample set of log files to test sending logs from a
file. This can be done with the following commands on mac with homebrew.
Installation instruction for flog can be found
[here](https://github.com/mingrammer/flog#installation).

```bash
flog --bytes $((100 * 1024 * 1024)) > sample.log
```

This will create a `100MiB` sample log file in the `sample.log` file.

### `make build`

This will _compile_ the `vector` project in _debug_ mode. Be aware that this
mode is not optimized and may run slowly. Generally speaking, `make build` can
be quite slow and poor for quick feedback. In most cases while developing
`vector` you may want to use `make check` instead.

### `make check`

This command will internally call `cargo check` which runs all the checks the
compiler would run normally without actually doing any linking or codegen.
This is a lot quicker than running `make build` and is perfect for when you
want to get quick feedback. To ensure that you check every code path this
will check every feature, every target (including tests and benches), and
test every crate in the workspace. This command is what is run on the
`check-stable` CI job.

### `make run`

Vector can also be run in debug mode via calling `make run`. Though this may
not be sufficient since you may need to pass arguments to the `vector` binary.

```bash
# To run it with a custom config
cargo run -- -c <path to config>
```

### `make bench`

This will run our internal set of benchmarks mainly used for find regressions
and comparing implementations. All the benchmarks live within `/benches`.

```bash
make bench
```

## CI

Currently Vector uses [CircleCI](https://circleci.com). The build process
is defined in `/.circleci/config.yml`. This delegates heavily to the
[`distribution/docker`](/distribution/docker) folder where Docker images are
defined for all of our testing, building, verifying, and releasing.

## Code Style

We use `rustfmt` on `stable` to format our code and CI will verify that your
code follows
this format style. To run the following command make sure `rustfmt` has been
installed on the stable toolchain locally.

```bash
# To install rustfmt
rustup component add rustfmt

# To format the code
make fmt
```
