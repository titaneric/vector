# Security Policy

We understand that many users place a high level of trust in Vector to collect
and ship mission critical data. The security of Vector is a top priority.
That's why we apply widely accepted best practices when it comes to security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We deeply appreciate any effort to discover and disclose security
vulnerabilities responsibly.

If you would like to report a vulnerability, or have any security concerns with
Vector, please e-mail vector@timber.io.

For non-critical matters, we prefer users [open an issue][urls.new_security_report].
In order for us to best investigate your request, please include any of the
following when reporting:

* Proof of concept
* Any tools, including versions used
* Any relevant output

We take all disclosures very seriously and will do our best to rapidly respond
and verify the vulnerability before taking the necessary steps to fix it. After
our initial reply to your disclosure, which should be directly after receiving
it, we will periodically update you with the status of the fix.
