# Documenting

This document covers the basics of writing documentation within Vector.
In this document:

## Making Changes

1. Vector's documentation is located in the [/docs](/docs) folder.
2. If the file contains an "AUTOGENERATED" warning at the top, do not
   modify the file directly. Instead modify the referenced template.
3. Run `make generate` to re-generate files.

## Dynamic Content

See the [scripts/generate](scripts/generate) folder for details on dynamic
content and how it works.

## Conventions

See the [Conventions](/docs/meta/conventions.md) doc for details on how to
properly write documentation for Vector.
